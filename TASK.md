# Python Bindings

Write a small class in C++, which at least has the functionality to take an image as an input, modify the image, and return the modified image. The functionality and the software architecture are up to you. Then write Python bindings for the class (using e.g., pybind11) and build the library. Finally, write a small Python script that uses the new library to perform the implemented operation on an image, and displays the original image and the result.
